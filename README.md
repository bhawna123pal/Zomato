# Zomato-Power-Bi-Dashboard
I Have created Power BI dashboard on "Zomato Restaurants Dataset".

Dataset Source : Kaggle

Features :
1. Top rated Restaurants in the city, and lowest rated restaurants in the city with average rating and average price for two people in the restaurant.

2. Cards that are showing Zomato Restaurants in the world including 15 countries, in which we can select 1 country and in that one city we can also see total no. of restaurants in that particular city., we have taken Zomato Restaurants in Delhi in the first page.

3. We can select the Highest and lowest rated Restaurants according to the city.

4. The Dashboard Shows best restaurants in the city with star visualization as rating and average cost for two people by city filter we can see each restaurant average rating and average price by clicking in the slicer.

5. It will be beneficial for Zomato that why these restaurants are rated so low and needs improvement etc.

please rate my work.
